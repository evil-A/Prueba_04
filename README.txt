At first I had no knoledge of what is backend or frontend. Never programmed in Javascript / NodeJS / HTML / CSS. Indeed I didn't know what a Frameworks was, how to make a web application or ever use an API.

To see the work in progress go to the directory "/moz-todo-react" and write "npm start"

All the work that has be done is in that directory, specially in the files:
/src/App.js
/src/index.js
/App.css

All the practice learnings I made today are in there. I thats not posible, here there's and advance:

At this point I decided to spend the time of this test as an entertained learning experience and I scheduled my time like this:

First 2 hours, documentation and getting in touch with concepts:

1. Start reading about frameworks and ReactJS.

Third Hour, practical approaching to simple concepts:

2.Need to install node.js to use the create-react-app.dev

-Cant't do it the suggested way so jumped to brew installer.
-brew install worked. Check versions installed (node -v, npm -v, npx -v)
-npx create-react-app moz-todo-react --use-npm
-and install create-react-app
-npm start
-basic concepts about html (I can change the title!)
-<br></br> Adds new lines!

New concepts learned:

DOM
React
npm & npx
